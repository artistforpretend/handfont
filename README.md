# handfont
This project is spawned off my need to create a font that looks like my handwriting without paying
for any services i.e. Adobe subscriptions or web file converters that charge for server usage. Ideally,
this will be used by artist/designers so they can create customizable, handwritten fonts for their
games, illustration,website,or graphic novels/webtoons without paying anything out of their own
pocket.

This project has no architectural structure. This is a learning project to program
any bit of the process that can be done by a computer in creating a font that based
off human handwriting.
