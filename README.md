# handfont
This project is spawned off my need to create a font that looks like my handwriting 
without paying for any services i.e. Adobe subscriptions or web file converters that
charge for server usage. Ideally,this will be used by artist/designers on a budget 
so they can create customizable, handwritten fonts for their games, illustration,
website, or graphic novels/webtoons at no fiscal cost.

This project has no architectural structure. This is a learning project to program
any part of the process that can be done by a computer to lighten the tedious/manual
portion of creating a handwritten font, so artist can focus on design and/or
hand-calligraphy.
